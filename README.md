## Abstract
Swin-FSR is a groundbreaking model designed to address the challenges of super-resolution imaging in remote and constrained environments. Leveraging Swin Transformer with spatial and depth-wise attention mechanisms, Swin-FSR achieves remarkable results in enhancing the resolution of fundus images, crucial for accurate disease identification. With a Peak signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) of 47.89, 49.00, and 45.32 on prominent datasets such as iChallenge-AMD, iChallenge-PM, and G1020, respectively, Swin-FSR demonstrates its efficacy in improving image quality across diverse visual domains. Additionally, when applied to the analysis of images related to Spaceflight Associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome (SANS), Swin-FSR yields comparable results to previous architectures, showcasing its versatility and robustness in various medical imaging applications
